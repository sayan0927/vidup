# VIDUP â€“ Video Streaming Application
## Overview

VIDUP is a video streaming web application designed to handle video uploads, real-time streaming, webcam recording, downloading, and a host of user engagement features such as likes/dislikes, comments, playlists, and subscriptions. The application utilizes a hybrid microservice and modulith architecture to provide a scalable, flexible platform that can process videos, detect NSFW content, and manage content efficiently across different services.

The backend is the primary focus of this project, with a proof-of-concept frontend built using Thymeleaf. Though functional, a more robust client-side application is required for production readiness.
Key Features

    Real-Time Streaming: Utilizes MPEG-DASH for adaptive bitrate streaming, ensuring smooth playback across varying network conditions and devices.
    Webcam Recording: Users can record videos directly from their browsers.
    User Engagement: Users can interact with content through comments, likes/dislikes, playlists, and subscriptions.
    NSFW Detection: Videos are automatically checked for inappropriate content using a separate Python microservice.
    Statistics and Analytics: Content creators can access performance metrics on their videos.
    Search and Filter: Powerful search functionality with tagging and filtering capabilities.
